module Todo where
{-| TodoMVC implemented in Elm, using plain HTML and CSS for rendering.

This application is broken up into four distinct parts:

  1. Model  - a full definition of the application's state
  2. Update - a way to step the application state forward
  3. View   - a way to visualize our application state with HTML
  4. Inputs - the signals necessary to manage events

This clean division of concerns is a core part of Elm. You can read more about
this in the Pong tutorial: http://elm-lang.org/blog/Pong.elm

This program is not particularly large, so definitely see the following
document for notes on structuring more complex GUIs with Elm:
